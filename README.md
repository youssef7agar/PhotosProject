# Photos Project
### Tools:
  Used RxKotlin<br/>
  Used Dagger<br/>
  Used retrofit for networking<br/>
  Used glide to load and attach the images<br/>
  Used mockitokotlin2 alongside with junit for unit testing<br/>
### Architecture:
  Used MVVM
# Note:<br/>
You would see i used a different approach to try and load the image in the image dialog just to get a clearer message as the images win't load because they're not found.
